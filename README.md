# Depth_measure
Android app for determining depth of downrigger

The downrigger weighs down the fishing line to take it to a certain depth, preferably for deeper water fishing. It is assumed that 
the downrigger is approximately at a ninety degree angle (straight down below the boat). The user will enter the amount of fishing line
they have released, and then enter the angle at which the fishing line is entering the water. With the two angles and length of the 
hypotenuse, the depth of the downrigger (and therefore the end of the fishing line with the hook and bait) is determined.

The app will consist of a main page, instructions page, about page (including attributions for images and contact information), and the 
calculation page which will have fields for entering values. Values will be in floating point to allow for decimal values to be 
entered into the equation. 

The project is currently being made with Android Studio Chipmunk 2021.2.1 patch 2. Java JDK 18.
